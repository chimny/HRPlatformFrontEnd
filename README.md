This is the front-end of the HR Platform app. It is built with React and Redux.

This is the front-end portion of the HR Platform application, which provides a full-stack solution for managing employee data. This is the first full stack project of the author, which includes all CRUD features (adding, modifying, and deleting employees). The app uses Material UI styling components for a clean and modern user interface.
